1. When parsing a text file, what determines the end of a line?
a. Return code
b. Nothing; Python sees it as one big string
c. \n or EoF
d. All of the above

ans: C. The end-of-line is the last character of a line of text before the text wraps to the
next line. This is identified as \n or as EoF (end of file).
=======================================================================================
2. What syntax would you use to open a text file to be written to?
a. data = open("text.txt", "w")
b. data = load("text.txt", "w")
c. load("text.txt", "w")
d. open("text.txt", "w")

ans: A. In order to open a file for writing, you need to use the open() function and assign
it to a file handler variable—in this case, data. In addition, you need to pass the name
of the file and tell Python that you want to allow write access to it (using “w”).

3. Which of the following do you use to write to a CSV file in Python?
a.
with open("text.csv", "a") as filehandle:
csv_writer = csv.write(filehandle)
csv_writer.writerow(data)
b.
with open("text.csv", "a") as filehandle:
csv_writer.writerow(data)
c.
with open("text.csv", "a") as filehandle:
csv_writer = csv.writer(filehandle)
csv_writer.writerow(data)
d.
with open("text.csv", "a") as filehandle:
csv_writer = csv.writer(f)
csv_writer.writerow(data)

ans: C. Using the with open combo to the text.csv file, you map it to the file-
handle object. Map csv_writer, which is just another Python object, to the csv.
writer(filehandle) function. Next, you write your data to the CSV file by calling the
.writerow method.

4. Which module is imported to read XML data?
a. xmlm
b. xmltodict
c. XMLParse
d. None of the above

ans: B. The xmltodict module reads XML data

5. Which methods are used for converting a native JSON file to Python and then back to
JSON? (Choose two.)
a. load() and dump()
b. loads() and dump()
c. loads() and dumps()
d. load() and dumps()

ans: A, C. To load a native JSON file into a Python string object, you use loads(), which
stands for load string, and to convert a Python string into native JSON, you use
dump().
=======================================================================================
6. What does YAML stand for?
a. Yet Another Markup Language
b. YAML Ain’t Markup Language
c. The name of its creator
d. None of the above

ans: B. YAML stands for YAML Ain’t Markup Language
=======================================================================================
7. What is the syntax for error handling in Python?
a. try-except-else-finally
b. raise ErrorMessage
c. assertErrorValue
d. All of the above

ans: A. Error handling in Python can be conducted by using a try-except-else-finally
block.
=======================================================================================
8. When does the finally block execute?
a. After the try block is successful
b. After the except block
c. At the end of every try block
d. When an error code stops the else block

ans: C. finally is executed every time the code runs through the try block. It is often used
to clean up variables or alert the user to a success or failure event.
=======================================================================================
9. Test-driven development requires that developers:
a. Create a unit test for every bit of code they write
b. Know how to use DevOps tools for automated testing
c. Create a simple test that fails and then write code that allows the test to succeed
d. Completely unnecessary in an Agile development shop

ans: C. Test-driven development focuses on writing code that allows a previously written
test (that naturally fails since no code was written) to succeed.
=======================================================================================
10. What is the difference between a unit test and an integration test? (Choose two.)
a. An integration test is for validation of how different parts of the application work
together.
b. An integration test verifies that the application operates as expected.
c. A unit test verifies API functionality.
d. A unit test is most specific in scope and tests small bits of code.

ans: A, D. An integration test is for API verification, and a function test verifies that your
application meets the agreed-upon requirements of how it should operate.
=======================================================================================
11. Which class is inherited as part of a unit test?
a. unittest.testcase
b. unittest.TestCase
c. unittest
d. TestCase

ans: B. unittest.TestCase is a special class that is used to access the unittest module’s
capabilities.

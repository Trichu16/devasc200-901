1. Which of the following is a sample use case of a southbound API?
a. Pushing network configuration changes down to devices
b. Increasing security
c. Streaming telemetry
d. Sending information to the cloud

ans: A. Southbound APIs send information down to devices within the network.

2. What are some benefits of using asynchronous APIs? (Choose two.)
a. Not having to wait on a response to process data
b. Reduced processing time
c. Increased processing time
d. Data function reuse

ans: A, B. Because asynchronous APIs do not have to wait for replies, they reduce the
time required to process data.

3. What are the HTTP functions used for API communication? (Choose three.)
a. GET
b. SOURCE
c. PURGE
d. PATCH
e. PUT

ans: A, D, E. SOURCE and PURGE do not exist. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
are the HTTP functions.

4. True or false: RESTful API authentication can use API keys or custom tokens.
a. True
b. False

ans: A. Both API keys and custom tokens are commonly used within API authentication.

5. What does SOAP stand for?
a. Software Operations and Procedures
b. Software Operations Authentication Protocol
c. Simple Object Access Protocol
d.Simple Operations Automation Platform
e. Support Object Abstract Protocol

ans: C. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.

6. What are the main components of SOAP messages? (Choose all that apply.)
a. Envelope
b. Header
c. Destination
d. Body
e. Fault
f. Authentication
g. Source

ans: A, B, D, E. The four main components of a SOAP message are the envelope, header,
body, and fault. The fault is an optional component.

7. Remote-procedure calls (RPCs) behave similarly to which of the following?
a. Synchronous API
b. Asynchronous API

ans: A. RPCs are blocked during the waiting periods. Once a procedure is executed and
the response is sent from the server and received on the client, the execution of the
procedure continues. This is similar to a synchronous API.

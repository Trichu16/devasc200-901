1. What network protocols support model-driven programmability? (Choose three.)
a. NETCONF
b. RESTCONF
c. SSH
d. gRPC

ans: A, B, D. There are three standards-based programmable interfaces for operating on
the YANG data models: NETCONF, RESTCONF, and gRPC.
=======================================================================================
2. What is the default port on which the NETCONF protocol runs?
a. TCP 22
b. TCP 830
c. UDP 161
d. UDP 69
ans: B. By default, the NETCONF server on the device runs on TCP port 830 and uses
the SSH process for transport.
=======================================================================================
3. What framework does NETCONF use to exchange messages between the client and
   the server?
a. REST
b. gRPC
c. Apache Avro
d. RPCs
ans: D. Messages sent with NETCONF use remote procedure calls (RPCs), a standard
framework for clients to send a request to a server to perform an action and return
the results.
=======================================================================================
4. Which data type is not a YANG base data type?
a. Binary
b. Enumeration
c. Percent
d. Empty
ans: C. YANG defines a set of built-in types and has a mechanism through which additional
types can be defined. There are more than 20 base types, including binary,
enumeration, and empty. Percent is not a built-in data type.
=======================================================================================
5. Which component of a YANG module header uniquely identifies a module?
a. Prefix
b. Notification
c. Namespace
d. Organization name
ans: C. The YANG header contains the namespace for the module. The namespace is used
to uniquely identify each module on a system that implements NETCONF.
=======================================================================================
6. Which of the following is a popular Python library used to interact with NETCONF
   servers?
a. requests
b. ncclient
c. json
d. pyang
ans: B. One popular NETCONF client is the Python 3 ncclient library
=======================================================================================
7. Which of the following are used for data encapsulation in RESTCONF messages? (Choose two.)
a. XML
b. YANG
c. YAML
d. JSON
ans: A, D. RESTCONF data is encoded with either XML or JSON. Compared with
NETCONF, RESTCONF has added support for JSON encoding.
=======================================================================================
8. What NETCONF operation is the equivalent of the RESTCONF PATCH method?
a. <edit-config> (operation=”merge”)
b. <edit-config> (operation=”create/replace”)
c. <edit-config> (operation=”patch”)
d. <patch-config>
ans: A. The PATCH method provides a resource patching mechanism. It is equivalent to
the NETCONF <edit-config> operation with operation=merge.
=======================================================================================
9. What RESTCONF resource allows for automatic discovery of the API root?
a. /discover/restconf
b. /.well-known/restconf
c. /.well-known/host-meta
d. /discover/root
ans: C. Per the RESTCONF standard, devices implementing the RESTCONF protocol
should expose a resource called /.well-known/host-meta to enable discovery of root
programmatically.
=======================================================================================
10. What types of subscriptions are supported by model-driven telemetry? (Choose two.)
a. Static
b. Dynamic
c. Configured
d. Hard-coded
ans: B, C. There are two types of telemetry subscriptions. With a dynamic subscription,
the subscriber sends a request, usually via the ietf-yangpush.yang data model. A
configured subscription is configured via the CLI, NETCONF, or RESTCONF and is
persistent between reboots.

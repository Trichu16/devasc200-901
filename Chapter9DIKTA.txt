1. On what family of switches does Cisco ACI run?
a. Cisco Catalyst 9000
b. Cisco Nexus 9000
c. Cisco Nexus 7000
d. Cisco Catalyst 6800

ans: The Cisco Nexus 9000 family of switches can run in two separate modes of oper-
ation, depending on the software that is loaded. The first mode is called standalone
(or NX-OS) mode, which means the switches act like regular Layer 2/Layer 3 data
center devices, which are usually managed individually. The second mode is called
ACI mode, in which the Cisco Nexus devices are part of an ACI fabric and are
managed in a centralized fashion.

2. True or false: An ACI bridge domain can be associated with multiple VRF instances.
a. True
b. False

ans: B. Bridge domains represent the Layer 2 forwarding domains within the fabric and
define the unique MAC address space and flooding domain for broadcast, unknown
unicast, and multicast frames. Each bridge domain is associated with only one VRF
instance, but a VRF instance can be associated with multiple bridge domains.

3. What Cisco ACI REST API endpoint is used for authentication?
a. https://APIC_IP_or_Hostname/api/aaaLogin.json
b. https://APIC_IP_or_Hostname/api/login
c. https://APIC_IP_or_Hostname/api/v1/aaaLogin
d. https://APIC_IP_or_Hostname/api/v1/login.json

   figuration of a physical server?
a. Server profile
b. Service profile
c. Template profile
d. None of the above

ans: B. The service profile is a logical construct in UCS Manager that contains
the complete configuration of a physical server. All the elements of a server configuration—including RAID levels, BIOS settings, firmware revisions and set-
tings, adapter settings, network and storage settings, and data center connectivity—
are included in the service profile.

6. What is the managed object browser called in Cisco UCS Manager?
a. Mobrowser
b. UCSMobrowser
c. Visore
d. UCSVisore

8. What is the name of the header that contains the Cisco UCS Director REST API
   access key?
a. X-Cloupia-Access-Key
b. X-Cloupia-Request-Key
c. X-Cloupia-Secret-Key
d. X-Cloupia-API-Access

ans: B. Each REST API request must be associated with an HTTP header called X-Clou-
pia-Request-Key, with its value set to the REST API access key.
=======================================================================================
9. How are the managed objects organized in Cisco Intersight?
a. Management information table
b. Hierarchical management information tree
c. Management Information Model
d. Hierarchical Managed Objects Model

ans: C. The Intersight API is a programmatic interface to the Management Information
Model similar to Cisco ACI and Cisco UCS Manager. Just like Cisco ACI and Cisco
UCS Manager, the Cisco Intersight Management Information Model is comprised of
managed objects.
=======================================================================================
10. What does the Cisco Intersight REST API key contain?
a. keyId and keySecret
b. token
c. accessKey and secretKey
d. cookie
